## Welcome to the `gml-highscorer` repository!<br/>
_Highscores &amp; Trophies for your GameMaker Game_

This repository contains the full source code of my highscore-library, including a ready-to-use renderer for HighscoreTables in your game.
You can render a normal looking highscore or even a more sophisticated _TrophyTable_.

Rendering is very efficient, as the table is pre-rendered onto a surface and only the surface is drawn in the Draw (or DrawGUI) event.

## Here's what it can look like
![screen_default_score](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19487451/183867594-7d515db0-d70c-4906-8967-321d7c1f54ac.png)

The renderers are highly configurable through their extensive _Variable Definitions_. Take a look at the wiki for details on how to use it.

### Don't want to clone and play with the source code?
No problem, just head over to the [Releases]() and get the `.yymps` local package for easy import.

## Part of gml-raptor
This library is also packaged into my [gml-raptor](https://github.com/Grisgram/gml-raptor) platform, where it is super-easy to save and restore your highscore lists by simply adding them to raptor's `GLOBALDATA` struct or attaching it to the `data` member of your _MainRoomController_, whatever you prefer.

### Personal note
As always, if you like what you see, please âœ¨ the repository and consider following me. The more reach these libraries get, the better they can evolve!

If you have an idea, how to improve this library, just open a pull request! I will gladly accept contributions as long as they fit the spirit of the library.

Have fun with the highscorer!
Yours,
Gris
